        <ol>
            <li><b>Browser Object Model (BOM)</b>: a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Chapter 9: The Window Object</h2>
        <p>The global object in a browser environment is the window object, a representation of the browser window that contains a web page.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>BOM only makes sense in a browser environment
                <ul>
                    <li>JS can be run in different environments, so environments like Node.js wouldn't have a window object</li>
                    <li>Such environments would still have a global object</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>In a browser environment, the global object is the window object
                <ul>
                    <li>Any global variable (declared without using const, let, or var) created is a property of the window object</li>
                    <li>In general, you can use a global variable without "window." unless you're checking is the global variable has been defined</li>
                    <li>Some predefined methods (like parseInt() and isNaN()) are are methods of the global object</li>
                    <li>Dialog methods are also included in this list of methods
                        <ul>
                            <li>window.alert(), .confirm(), and .prompt() are dialogs</li>
                            <li>Note that these should be used with caution since they stop the execution of a program and are also unreliable as they can be disabled from appearing</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>The window object has a number of properties and methods that provide info about the user's browser
                <ul>
                    <li>The navigator property returns a reference to the Navigator object
                        <ul>
                            <li>Navigator contains info about the browser being used while its userAgent will return information about the browser and OS being used</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>window.location is an object that contains info about the URL of the current page
                        <ul>
                            <li>href would return the full URL as a string</li>
                            <li>protocol returns a string describing the protocol ("https:" or "http:")</li>
                            <li>host returns a string of the domain of the current URL and the port number (often omitted if default port is 80)
                                <ul>
                                    <li class="example">window.location.host &#60;&#60; "www.sitepoint.com"</li>
                                    <li>location.hostname would return only the domain while location.port would return a port number (an empty string if port is not stated in the URL)</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>pathname returns a string of the path that follows the domain</li>
                            <li>And there are more properties and methods that location can use</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>history is a property that can be used to access info about previously visited paged in the current browser session</li>
                    <li>screen contains info about the screen the browser is displayed on, including width and height</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Down the tree of window objects is the Document object
                <ul>
                    <li>One method of the document object is write(); this has been discouraged since it mixes HTML and JavaScript</li>
                    <li>You can use cookies with the document object
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cookies can be used to personalize a user's experience on a website</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>window also has some useful methods for scheduling the execution of a function and for repeatedly executing functions at regular intervals
                <ul>
                    <li>setTimeout() accepts a callback to a function (first parameter) and a number of milliseconds (second parameter)
                        <ul>
                            <li class="example">window.setTimeout( () => alert("Time's up!"), 3000);</li>
                            <li>This method returns an integer that is an ID and can be used to reference a particular timeout; this integer can then be used with window.clearTimeout()</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li class="example">window.clearTimeout(int);</li>
                    <li>setInterval() will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds
                        <ul>
                            <li>To stop this, use clearInterval() with repeat as an argument because the setInterval method returns an ID that is assigned to the variable repeat</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Be careful of using "this" with timing methods because "this" will be bound to the window object</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I have seen websites that still use cookies. The textbook mentions that it's being used less due to localStorage. Is there any situation where you would willingly opt for cookies instead of localStorage?</li>
