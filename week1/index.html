    <h1>Week 1 Notes & Exercises</h1>
    <p>I didn't really take notes that much this week. I ended up doing the exercise in "Doing Stuff With Web Things" and leaving a few questions that I came up with.</p>
    <p><a href="editor.html">Story Editor Exercise</a></p>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When I think of storage with websites, I immediately think of backend methods. Is local storage a feasible substitution in certain situations?</li>
        <li>Is a combination of local storage and backend storage often used?</li>
    </ul>
