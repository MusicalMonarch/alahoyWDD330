        <h1>Week 4 Notes & Exercises</h1>
        <p>I decided to go along with one of the form examples. Here's the practice: <a href="search.html">A Searching Example</a></p>
        <ul>
            <li>When accessing form elements, you need to use the legacy DOM's property called document.forms
                <ul>
                    <li>This returns an HTML collection of all the forms, so you need to use index notation
                        <ul>
                            <li class="example">ex: const form = document.forms[0];</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>However, one can also use the name attribute instead
                        <ul>
                            <li class="example">ex: const form = document.forms.search;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Warning: If the form had the same name as any properties or methods of the document.forms object (like 'submit'), that property or method would be referenced instead of &lt;form&gt;
                        <ul>
                            <li>To avoid this, use square bracket notation</li>
                            <li class="example">const form = document.forms['search'];</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>A form object also has a method called elements that returns an HTML collection of all the elements contained in the form
                        <ul>
                            <li class="example">ex: const [input,button] = form.elements;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Form objects have a bunch of useful properties and methods
                <ul>
                    <li>The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically
                        <ul>
                            <li>Note: submitting a form using this method won't trigger the form submit event</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>form.reset() will reset all the form controls back to their initial values
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reset buttons are generally considered bad practice since they're too easy to click for something that can wipe out all the data</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>form.action can be used to set the action attribute of a form so it's sent to a different URL</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Forms trigger different events, some events being exclusive to forms
                <ul>
                    <li>The focus event occurs when an element is focused on
                        <ul>
                            <li class="example">ex: const input = form.elements.searchInput;<br>
                                input.addEventListener('focus', () => alert('focused'), false);
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The blur event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element
                        <ul>
                            <li class="example">ex: input.addEventListener('blur', () => alert('blurred'), false);</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The change event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element <i>after changing it</i>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If a user clicks an input field and clicks away, the change event will not fire (but the blur event will)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Text input element objects have a value property that can be used to retrieve the text inside the field
                <ul>
                    <li>You can change the value inside the input using JS</li>
                    <li>Alternatively, you can just use the placeholder attribute (I prefer this due to the fact that it does not count as a value)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Three are different form controls that can make web pages more interactive
                <ul>
                    <li>Input: fields, including text, passwords, checkboxes, radio buttons, file uploads</li>
                    <li>Select: menus for drop-down lists of options</li>
                    <li>Textarea: elements for longer text entry</li>
                    <li>Button: elements for submitting and resetting forms</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Some new attributes were introduced in HTML5
                <ul>
                    <li>For more reference, check this <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/html5-forms-markup/">article</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Form validation is the process of checking whether a user has entered information into the form correctly
                <ul>
                    <li>Validation can occur on the client side (with JS) and on the server side</li>
                    <li>Encouraged to do both</li>
                    <li>JS should not be relied upon to validate any data before it's saved to a database; it's possible for a user to modify and bypass the front-end</li>
                    <li>JS validation should be used to enhance the user's experience
                        <ul>
                            <li>This should be backed up with more validation on the server side before the data is eventually saved to the database</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A useful technique to ensure that no errors are submitted is disabling the submit button
                <ul>
                    <li>If the submit button is disabled, no action is taken when it's clicked</li>
                    <li>Most browsers will display it differently to indicate it can't be clicked</li>
                    <li>Prevents users from submitting a form with errors</li>
                    <li class="example">ex: &lt;button type='submit' id='submit' disabled&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;</li>
                    <li>Then this can be changed (with JS) when the form is properly filled out
                        <ul>
                            <li class="example">function disableSubmit(event) {<br>
                                &emsp;if(event.target.value === '') {<br>
                                    &emsp;&emsp;document.getElementById('submit').disabled = true;<br>
                                &emsp;} else {<br>
                                    &emsp;&emsp;document.getElementById('submit').disabled = false;<br>
                                &emsp;}
                            </li>
                            <li>You can call this in a keyup event</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
