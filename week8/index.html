        <h2>HTML5 & CSS3 for the Real World</h2>
        <h2>Chapter 8: Transforms & Transitions</h2>
        <p>Nowadays, CSS3 can handle certain tasks without JS needing to be written. It comes with features like tilt, scale, move, and flip.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Transform</b> is a CSS3 property that lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page
                <ul>
                    <li>An element's appearance can be manipulated using the transform functions</li>
                    <li>The value of the transform property is one or more transform functions that are applied in the order they're provided</li>
                    <li>Translation is one of the transform functions, and it allows you to move elements left, right, up, or down
                        <ul>
                            <li class="example">transform: translate(45px, -45px);</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Transforms require specific prefixing from the browser in order to work
                        <ul>
                            <li>To make code work, you would need to include some special code</li>
                            <li><img src="img/prefixing.JPG" alt="Example of prefixing for older browsers"></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>When transforming an element, only declare transform once (the cascade would have the last transform declaration override</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Translation is one of the transform functions, and it allows you to move elements left, right, up, or down
                <ul>
                    <li class="example">transform: translate(45px, -45px);</li>
                    <li>When using translation, you're moving elements without impacting the flow of the document</li>
                    <li>Unlike "position: relative" (position an element either against its current position, a parent, or other ancestor), translation can only move relative to the current position</li>
                    <li>You can use different code for when you only want to translate in one direction (either horizontally or vertically)
                        <ul>
                            <li class="example">transform: translateX(45px); transform: translateY(-30px);</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>The scale function scales an element through arguments in the parameters
                <ul>
                    <li>scale(x,y) takes the defined factors and scales horizontally, then vertically
                        <ul>
                            <li>If only one value is provided, it will scale the element while maintaining the original aspect ratio</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Much like translation, you can scale based on only vertical or horizontal direction
                        <ul>
                            <li>scaleX(x) or scaleY(y)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Scaling will only grow outwards from or shrink towards the element's cycle
                        <ul>
                            <li>This default behavior can be changed if you use "transform-origin"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Scaling also has no impact on document flow</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>The rotate function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value
                <ul>
                    <li>The default point of origin is the element's center</li>
                    <li>You can define an angle value with degrees, grads, radians, or turns, but you generally use degrees
                        <ul>
                            <li class="example">transform: rotate(40deg)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes
                <ul>
                    <li>X skews on the x axis, and Y skews on the y axis, and if the second parameter is omitted, the skew will only occur on the x axis
                        <ul>
                            <li class="example">transform: skew(15deg, 4deg)</li>
                            <li>This results in the following example</li>
                            <li class="skew-ex">Skewed Example</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>The origin of the transform can be changed from the default (center of the element) to something else using transform-origin
                <ul>
                    <li>It looks like this:
                        <ul>
                            <li class="example">transform-origin: 10% 10%;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Browser support for transform-origin is the same for transform</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Be careful when choosing your order of transform functions
                <ul>
                    <li>If you decide to rotate an element before translating, it will look differently than if you would translate before rotating</li>
                    <li>Here's an example from the textbook
                        <ul>
                            <li><img src="img/orderoftranslate.JPG" alt="Order of transformation matters"></li>
                            <li>The rightmost square - <span class="example">transform: translateX(200px) rotate(135deg);</span></li>
                            <li>The leftmost square - <span class="example">transform: rotate(135deg) translateX(200px);</span></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Transitions allow values of CSS properties to change over time, providing simple animations
                <ul>
                    <li>If a link changes color on hover, you can make it gradual through the transition property
                        <ul>
                            <li>If it's not supported by the browser, the change will be immediate, which is still okay</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>CSS transitions are declared along with the regular styles on an element</li>
                    <li>Here are the steps to create a simple transition using only CSS:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration</li>
                            <li>Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state</li>
                            <li>Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties, which include...
                                <ul>
                                    <li>transition-property</li>
                                    <li>transition-duration</li>
                                    <li>transition-timing-function</li>
                                    <li>transition-delay</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Note that transition is declared in the default or originating state</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>There are 4 properties that you can address with transition
                <ul>
                    <li>transition-property is necessary as it selects what CSS rule you want to apply the transition to</li>
                    <li>transition-duration sets how long the transition will take for the element to go from its original state to its transitioned state</li>
                    <li>transition-timing-function sets the speed at which the transition takes place, which can be anything ranging from starting slow and ending fast to starting fast and ending slow</li>
                    <li>transition-delay sets how long the transition is delayed before it starts
                        <ul>
                            <li>Note that you can use a negative delay for specific effects that require the transition to jump to a different part of the transition</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The transition property is shorthand for these properties
                        <ul>
                            <li class="example">transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;</li>
                            <li>It can be in any order</li>
                            <li>However, if you include a delay, a duration must precede it</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Unlike transitions, CSS animations let you control each step of an animation via keyframes
                <ul>
                    <li>You can define keyframes and then use them later on
                        <ul>
                            <li class="example">@keyframes appearDisappear { 0%, 100% { opacity: 0; } 20%, 80% { opacity: 1; } }</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>You can attach the animation to the "animation-name" property
                        <ul>
                            <li class="example">animation-name: appearDisappear;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Similarly to transition, animation has a duration property and timing function and delay</li>
                    <li>It also has other features like "animation-direction" and "animation-iteration-count"</li>
                    <li>"animation" is its own shorthand as well
                        <ul>
                            <li class="example">animation: 300ms ease-in alternate 5s backwards appearDisappear;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Be careful with naming your animation-name as using animation property key terms like "forwards", "running", or "alternate" can cause issues</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Both transition and animation can be grouped with multiple of their own calls
                <ul>
                    <li>You separate with a comma
                        <ul>
                            <li class="example">transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms, color 0.1s linear 50ms;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>You can do the same thing with animations
                        <ul>
                            <li class="example">animation: animationOne 300ms ..., animationTwo 600ms ...;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Chapter 12: Canvas, SVG, Drag & Drop</h2>
        <p>Essentially, Canvas is for drawing in a two-dimensional space with JavaScript</p>
        <p>Put a canvas in the HTML file.</p>
        <p class="example">&emsp;&emsp;&#60;canvas id="myCanvas" class="myCanvas" width="200" height="200"&#62;<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Sorry! Your browser doesn't support Canvas.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&#60;/canvas&#62;
        </p>
        <p>The text inside the canvas tag will only show if it is not supported by the browser. After placing the tag, you can get the Canvas object via the ID in JS. Then you can draw.Here is a list of resources for further reading on using canvas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://dev.opera.com/articles/html5-canvas-basics/">"HTML5 Canvas - the Basics" at Dev.Opera</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/resources/#documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/HTML-canvas-guide/Introduction/Introduction.html">Safari's HTML5 Canvas Guide</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>SVG is another way for developers to create shapes. There are differences between the two.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Canvas allows for pixel manipulation
                <ul>
                    <li>Operates in immediate mode; you can't add more to what's already been made inside a canvas</li>
                    <li>You can turn something inside a canvas black and white</li>
                    <li>No access to what's drawn on the canvas via the DOM</li>
                    <li>Faster than SVG and generally better for designing a game with a lot of animations</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Anything drawn in SVG is accessible via the DOM
                <ul>
                    <li>Operates in retained mode</li>
                    <li>You can't manipulate SVG the way you manipulate pixels on canvas</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you need to paint pixels to a screen without concerns about the ability to retrieve and modify shapes, canvas would be better. If you need to be able to access and change specific aspects of your graphics, SVG may be more appropriate.</p>
        <p>The chapter has a lot of interesting info on Drag & Drop, so here's two resources for further reading on it:</p>

        </ul>
